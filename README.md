# Sleep Disorder Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of sleep disorders using logistic regression. We collected data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and processed the dataset. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 85%. Additionally, a Streamlit app was developed for user-friendly predictions.

## Features

- **Real-time Predictions:**
  - Upload an image to get instant predictions for sleep disorders.
  - Stream video to see real-time classification results for each frame.

## Model

The classification model utilizes logistic regression. After training, it achieved an accuracy of 85%, making it effective for predicting sleep disorders like Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or No Sleep Disorder.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn for logistic regression
- Streamlit for web application
